= Setup a supported distribution =

For all the distributions your user need admin rights (i.e. it should be able to run the su command).

== Fedora 17 (32-bit and 64-bit)  ==

Works out of the box!

== Ubuntu 12.04 (32-bit and 64-bit) ==

By default only root can start the X server. You need to change that with

  sudo dpkg-reconfigure x11-common

I'm hoping we can get rid of this step in the next Ubuntu version when a working nested X server implementation should become available.

= Getting started =

Run the commands

    make build
    make run

That should be all you need to have sugar running!

= Developing and contributing =

First of all enter the sugar-build shell, this will ensure you have the right environment and will provide a few useful extra commands.

    make shell

You can find all the sources in sugar-build/source. Enter the desired module
directory and apply your modifications. To test them out, you need to install
the new code and start sugar

    make install
    start-sugar

Finally, when you have something worth contributing to the community, you should
send patches to the development mailing list. First of all commit all of your changes to git. Now to send the patches you just run

    send-patches

= Report bugs =

To generate bug report information

    make bug-report

I expect a lot of tweaks will be necessary before this is stable. In the future distributions upgrades will also be problematic. We need the build to work out of the box 99% of the time for everyone, so if stuff breaks don't please don't be shy and always report a bug (patches are appreciated of course but not required). If you install an activity and it doesn't work, that might also be a sugar-build bug, in doubt just report it.

= Reference =

== Makefile targets reference ==

make all            Build and install activities
make build		    Build all the modules.
make run		    Run sugar.
make build-[module] Build a single module.
make clean		    Delete build artifacts and sources.
make bug-report     Generate a bug report. 
make shell          Open a shell with proper build environment.
make test           Run UI tests

== Shell commands reference ==

start-sugar         Start sugar.
send-patches        Send local commits as patches for review.

Use --help for more informations about each command.

== Environment variables ==

SUGAR_OUTPUT

Sugar does not run properly on multiple video outputs, so we need to select one
and turn off the others. By default we select the first output listed by RandR.
You can set this variable to override that with any other of the connected
outputs reported by xrandr command, for example VGA1 if you have an external monitor.
